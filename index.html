                <br>

                    <p>Born in San Jose to a pair of swashbuckling pirates, whom after a brief stint searching for buried treasure ended up moving and posing as cowboys in Dallas, Texas.
                        Following high school, Aaron ended up marooned at NYU studying Film and Television. After Aaron became the subject of a witch hunt on account of a misunderstanding about the wealth gap in America, he was driven out of town by a large, elderly bourgeouis cult thriving around Gramercy Park...</p>
                    <p>With nowhere to turn, Aaron found refuge aboard a train smuggling blankets, bourbon and hipsters to Nashville. Aaron made fast friends with a group of musicians at a commune in an abondoned frathouse by the Auto Diesel College in East Nashville.
                        After the commune fell apart due to the aggressive antics of a 3-legged dog named Bonzo, Aaron fled to a recording studio deep in the ghetto of North Nashville. </p>
                    <p>After months of saving money while recording ramblin' misguided hip-hop soul artists, Aaron ended up in a love affair with the magic squirrel of Piedmont Park. The magical squirrel promptly cast a spell on Aaron allowing him access to a programming bootcamp at Georgia Tech where he now is.</p>
                    <p>And there you have it- the completely true history of Aaron Endelman.</p>
